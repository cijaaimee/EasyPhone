This app takes over a smartphone, providing a very simple interface for elderly people to make and
receive calls.

# Requirements
Android does everything in its power to prevent an app from taking over the entire OS. To simplify
development, I've made a custom ROM based on LineageOS to circumvent this. You can find the manifest
[here](https://github.com/cijaaimee/android).

# Note
* This is a personal project and not intended for public use. Both the app and the custom ROM are
tuned for a specific device: Redmi Note 7. As long as you follow the license, you're free to
play around with it. 
* I'm definitely not an expert in Android app development, so feel free to reach out if you have
any comments or suggestions!
